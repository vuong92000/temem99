# 📖 Usage

## 1. Configure API Key

Enter your free [Agnes AI](https://platform.agnes-ai.com) API key at the top of the page and save it. Or set it via environment variable:

```bash
export AGNES_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

## 2. Choose a Video Mode

| Resolution | Portrait 9:16 / Landscape 16:9 / Square 1:1 |
| Duration | 5s / 10s / 15s / 18s / 20s |
| Reference Image | Optional upload for image-to-video modes |

| Resolution | Portrait / Landscape / Square | - |
| Narration | Voice role and speech rate | - |
| Subtitle Style | Full subtitle customization | - |

> **Note**: Segment duration is auto-calculated based on text length (~4 chars/sec, 5–12s per segment) — no manual setting needed.

### Digital Anchor

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Anchor Script | Enter the text the anchor will say | Yes |
| Anchor Image | AI-generated or upload custom reference image | - |
| Resolution | Portrait / Landscape / Square | - |
| Narration | Voice role and speech rate | - |
| Subtitle Style | Full subtitle customization | - |

## 3. Click "Start Generating"

The progress panel shows real-time generation status for each step. For Creative Video: Init → Image Analysis → Story → Script → Narration → Character Reference → End Frame Prompts → End Frame Generation → Video Generation → Audio & Subtitles → Concatenation.

## 4. Checkpoint Resume & Task Management

If the server is interrupted, restart it and find the incomplete task in the "Task List" tab. Click "Resume" to continue from the last checkpoint. Running tasks can also be stopped and resumed later.

## 5. Manual Mode (v6.0)

> Full guide: [`manual_mode_guide.md`](./manual_mode_guide.md)

Manual mode pauses the pipeline at checkpoints so you can review or refine artifacts before continuing:

```
scenes → references → videos → audio → subtitle → final
```

- **Create**: choose "✋ Manual" at the top of the create panel and tick the pause points (defaults pre-filled per task type).
- **Switch anytime**: the "切回自动 / 切为手动" toggle on the task card. Auto→Manual suspends at the next safe point; Manual→Auto clears pause points and runs to completion immediately.
- **Three ways to handle artifacts** at a paused checkpoint:
  - 🤖 **AI Modify**: type a request, the system rewrites the artifact (text via chat / image via i2i / video via ffmpeg command).
  - ✏️ **Edit yourself**: copy the artifact path, edit locally, then click "I've modified, continue".
  - 🤝 **External Agent**: copy `cd <dir> && opencode` + prompt template, process, then confirm.
- **Change anything**: artifacts **and** task params (resolution / voice / duration / scene count) can be edited while paused. The system previews which artifacts will be deleted & re-run vs kept before you confirm (dependency graph).
- Not supported: simple / simple-image types (read-only artifact list after completion).

## ⚠️ Important Notes

This project is in early stage — corner cases may not be fully handled. Recommended workflow:

1. Fill in your idea on the page and submit an AI video task
2. Watch the **console logs** (the terminal running `server.py`) and be patient
3. All key operations are logged for easy debugging

### Log Reference

All important operations are logged to the server console:

| Prefix | Module |
|--------|--------|
| `[Startup]` | Server startup, stale task reset |
| `[WS]` | WebSocket connect/disconnect |
| `[Resume]` / `[Stop]` | Task resume/stop |
| `[Pipeline]` / `[Simple]` / `[Manuscript]` | Pipeline step execution |
| `[TTS]` / `[Subtitle]` | Audio and subtitle generation |
| `[Compositor]` | Video concatenation and processing |
| `[AgnesImage]` / `[AgnesVideo]` / `[AgnesChat]` | AI API calls |
| `[RateLimiter]` | Global rate limiter |
| `[TaskManager]` | Task state persistence |
| `[Screenwriter]` | Screenwriter Agent |

### Output Directory

All AI video task artifacts are stored under `.working_dir/{timestamp}_{task_id}/`:

```
.working_dir/{timestamp}_{task_id}/
